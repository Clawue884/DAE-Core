# DAE-Core
DAE-Core is the foundational framework for building a Decentralized Autonomous Economy (DAE) that empowers users through smart contracts, decentralized identity verification, and tokenized incentive mechanisms. This project aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where participants can engage in peer-to-peer transactions, contribute to governance, and access a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). By leveraging advanced technologies and promoting interoperability, DAE-Core seeks to enhance the utility of the Pi cryptocurrency while fostering a vibrant and collaborative community.
