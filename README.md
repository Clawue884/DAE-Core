# DAE-Core
DAE-Core is the foundational framework for building a Decentralized Autonomous Economy (DAE) that empowers users through smart contracts, decentralized identity verification, and tokenized incentive mechanisms. This project aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where participants can engage in peer-to-peer transactions, contribute to governance, and access a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). By leveraging advanced technologies and promoting interoperability, DAE-Core seeks to enhance the utility of the Pi cryptocurrency while fostering a vibrant and collaborative community.

# DAE-Core

Decentralized Autonomous Economy (DAE) Framework

## Overview

DAE-Core is an open-source framework for building decentralized autonomous economies. It provides a set of tools and protocols for creating, managing, and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) on a blockchain network.

## Features

* Decentralized identity verification
* Tokenized incentive mechanisms
* Smart contract-based governance
* Decentralized marketplace for dApps
* Interoperability with multiple blockchain networks
