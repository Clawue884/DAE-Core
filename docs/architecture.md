# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The DAE-Core framework is designed to facilitate the creation and management of decentralized applications (dApps) within a decentralized autonomous economy. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, including its components and interactions.

## Components

1. **Smart Contracts**
   - Deployed on the blockchain, these contracts govern the rules and logic of the DAE.
   - Key contracts include:
     - Token contract for managing the native currency.
     - Governance contract for proposal and voting mechanisms.
     - Identity contract for decentralized identity verification.

2. **Frontend Application**
   - A user interface built using modern web technologies (e.g., React).
   - Interacts with the blockchain via Web3.js or similar libraries.

3. **Backend Services**
   - Node.js services that handle business logic, data storage, and interactions with the blockchain.
   - Services include transaction management, identity verification, and governance processes.

4. **Database**
   - A NoSQL or SQL database for storing off-chain data, such as user profiles and transaction history.
