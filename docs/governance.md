# Governance Mechanisms in DAE-Core

## Introduction

Governance is a critical aspect of the DAE-Core framework, enabling decentralized decision-making and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. This document outlines the governance mechanisms, including proposal creation, voting, and proposal execution.

## Proposal Creation

- **Proposal Types**: There are two types of proposals:
  1. **Parameter Proposals**: Modify existing parameters, such as token supply or voting periods.
  2. **Smart Contract Proposals**: Deploy new smart contracts or modify existing ones.

- **Proposal Creation Process**:
  1. **Submission**: A user submits a proposal with a title, description, and options (if applicable).
  2. **Review**: The proposal is reviewed by the community to ensure it meets the required standards.
  3. **Voting**: The proposal is put up for voting, where users can cast their votes in favor or against the proposal.

## Voting Mechanism

- **Voting Period**: The voting period is set to a fixed duration (e.g., 7 days).
- **Voting Options**: Users can vote in favor or against the proposal.
- **Quorum**: A minimum percentage of users must participate in the vote for it to be valid.

## Proposal Execution

- **Proposal Execution**: If a proposal is approved, it is executed by the governance contract.
- **Proposal Rejection**: If a proposal is rejected, it is removed from the system.

## Conclusion

The governance mechanisms in DAE-Core are designed to ensure decentralized decision-making, transparency, and accountability. By participating in the governance process, users can shape the future of the ecosystem and contribute to its growth and success.
